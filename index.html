        4. It is thus clearly shown that 
          one advantage of topic is the reduction of air pollution.

            the problem of traffic jams can be signifcantly alleviated when people choose the topic. 
        4. Undoubtedly

            another advantage of the topic is fewer traffic jams.

          1. due to the reasons outlined above
            I have a strong belief that the advantages of the topic are
          2. In order to move things forward
            all parties involved must make a concerted effort to communicate and start changing. 
          3. With all our efforts
            we can certainly make this world a much better place to live.
